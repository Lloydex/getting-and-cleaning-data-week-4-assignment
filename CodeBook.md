# Tidy data set description

### The variables in the tidy data
Tidy data contains 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.

##How to get to the tinyData.txt:
1. Download data from the link below and unzip it into working directory of R Studio.
2. Execute the R script.


###Details of R script execution
1. Reading data
  1.1.reading the train data
  1.2.reading test data
  1.3.reading features of the data
  1.4.reading activity labels
2. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Useing descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##the source of data
The source data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

### Only all the variables estimated from mean and standard deviation in the tidy set were kept.

* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation

### The data were averaged based on subject and activity group.

Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30.
Activity column has 6 types as listed below.
1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING
